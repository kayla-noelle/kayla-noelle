# Hi, I'm Kayla 👋 👋

## About Me ✨

I'm a Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in visual design. Before transitioning into engineering, I spent several years as a **graphic designer**, which shaped my eye for detail, thoughtful UX, and clean, intentional interfaces.

I transitioned into front-end development through Thinkful's Software Engineering program and have been working in the web space ever since. I'm currently seeking a **full-time Front-End Developer role**, where I can combine my creative background with my technical skills.

In the meantime, I'm continuously learning to stay sharp and up-to-date with modern development tools and best practices.
